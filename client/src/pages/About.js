      <p>
        Hello My name is Dhruv Kumar Azad and i created this website. I am a ful
        stack developer and this website is one of my project.
        <br />
        So i developed this website for two reasons, one is that i always wanted
        a place where i can post my thoughts, express my feelings on different
        topics and specially post blogs. Ofcourse there are many other platforms
        for that but i wanted something which i have created.
        <br />
        And Second reason is that i really wanted to add a new website to my
        portfolio. So i can put this website on my Resume which represents a
        fraction of my skills in web developement.
        <br />
        I have used MERN stack to develope this website. For more information,
        you can contact me through linkdin, github, twitter and instagram, you
        can see the links at the bottom of this page.
        <br />
